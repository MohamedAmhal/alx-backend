## Pagination Techniques

### Offset Pagination

Offset pagination is the simplest form of pagination, using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` in SQL queries. It is easy to implement but can be inefficient for large datasets.

### Keyset Pagination

Keyset pagination uses the last seen item to fetch the next set of items. It is more efficient than offset pagination, especially for large datasets, but requires indexing.

### Seek Pagination

Seek pagination is an extension of keyset pagination. It uses a unique identifier to fetch the next set of items, providing consistent performance and decoupling pagination logic from filters.
